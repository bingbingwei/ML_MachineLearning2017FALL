# Machine Learning
## Brief
The projects of Prof. Hung-yi Lee's Machine Learning course. Mainly contains different experiments over different kinds of tasks.
(course website:http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/courses_ML17_2.html)

## Technique
* Basic Machine Learning's mathematic theories
* knowledge and implement of neuron networks
* familiar to **python keras, sklearn, xgboost**... libraries

## Details
### hw1
* brief: predict PM2.5 density in the air
* tech : implement the mathematic details of gradient descending and adagrad

### hw2
* brief: analyse behavior of bank customers
* tech : implement **logistic regression** and **XGBoost**
* result: 87% accuracy of predicting will a customer retrun the money or not.

### hw3
* brief: analyse one's mood by image of one's face 
* tech : implement **CNN** and compare the results with DNN models
* result: about 65% accuracy

### hw4
* brief: analyse one's mood by what one said
* tech : implement **RNN** and do experient over different RNN models(LSTM,GRU...etc) and Bag Of Words model.
* result: about 83% accuracy

### hw5
* brief: analyse one's favor(1-10 point) over movies by semi-labeled data
* tech : **semi-supervised** learning, **Word Embedding** technique and ensemble
* result: Mean Square Error 0.85
